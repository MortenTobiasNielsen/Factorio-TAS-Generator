### Tooling
The [latest release](https://github.com/theis999/TAS-Helper-for-Factorio/releases) can stand on its own, but these tools are recommended:

* [Game speed controls](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/game-speed) — To help zoom in on the important actions
* [TAS step planner](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/TAS_step_planner) — To help with building a plan from inside factorio
* [TAS Precision helper](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Theis_tas_helper) — Provides precision control data and also shows list of TAS steps
* [TAS state printer](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/TAS_state_printer) — To help with run desyncs, when you have changed something in the past and it has cascading effect

*If you find another tool, do let us know*.

### Features and problems
**Bugs** can be reported through [Issues](https://github.com/theis999/TAS-Helper-for-Factorio/issues), and **new features** can be requested there too.

## How it works
This tools works by converting a list of steps into a Factorio mod. The mod will then force the character to execute each step until it reaches the goal.
The list of steps is saved in a csv-like text file, and is displayed in a grid table through the tool.

Steps are executed using [Factorio's Lua API](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/), so while we strive to simulate realistic inputs, there are still differences.
A few of the more noteworthy differences:
* The TAS doesn't need the cursor, however it is still bound by character reach distance.
* Huge rocks always yield 47 coal and 47 stone. Instead of the random yields in regular play, which can create some hard to deal with incosistencies.
* Construction robots are not available.
